This playbook:

Updates all packages using the generic package module (works on both apt/yum)

Checks if reboot is needed by testing for the existence of /var/run/reboot-required

Only reboots if both:

Packages were actually updated (pkg_update.changed)

The system indicates a reboot is needed (reboot_needed.rc == 0)

Waits for the server to come back online after rebooting

Finally confirms the system is responsive with a ping test
