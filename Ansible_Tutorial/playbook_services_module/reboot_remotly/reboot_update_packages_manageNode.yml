        #This playbook:

          #Updates all packages using the generic package module (works on both apt/yum)

#Checks if reboot is needed by testing for the existence of /var/run/reboot-required

#Only reboots if both:

  #Packages were actually updated (pkg_update.changed)

#The system indicates a reboot is needed (reboot_needed.rc == 0)

#Waits for the server to come back online after rebooting

#Finally confirms the system is responsive with a ping test
